This is a sample application that uses Flask and SQLAlchemy to create a simple web application.
The idea of the application is to create a hub of book reviews. Users can create an account, log in, and then review books. They can also see the reviews made by other people.

Implemented Features:
- Registration
- Login
- Logout
- Book reviews (users can search for books, leave reviews for individual books, and see the reviews made by other people)

TODO:
- Add API access
- Search for books using the openlibrary API
- Add Goodreads reviews?
- Spruce up the UI, especially the profile page
